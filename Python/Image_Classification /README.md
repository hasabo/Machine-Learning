In this project, we will introduce one of the core problems in computer vision, which is image classification. It is defined as the task of classifying an image from a fixed set of categories. Many other computer vision challenges such as object detection and segmentation can be reduced to image classification. Throughout this project, we will start by exploring our dataset, then show how to preprocess and prepare the images to be a valid input for our learning algorithms. Finally we will explain relevant and the implemented  machine learning techniques for image classification such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
